# python-bulk-wrod-definition-finder
So basically I made this thing for class becuase I had a dumb assignment where I had to find a bunch of definitions of words. It took me like 5 hours to make and it did its job in like a minute with like 96 words so now I don't have a use for it.
# how it works
I use python 3 with beautiful soup 4 to scrape merriam webster for the words type and definition. I know it is not efficient and like I didn't need to make the words classes but I didnt really plan how I was going to do it and kinda just did it that way. I would fix it if I needed it, but I dont so yeah.
# input
There is a text file called words where you put in the word then two line breaks. I did it this way becuase that's how I was given the words for the assignment. You just need to figure out a way to get the words individually to make a list of the words.
